Step 1: Process using the C code.
                1.1 obtain nc files, use manual check to obtain the Er values
                1.2 Use Depth Correction.
                1.3 Use cutbins, and actually cut the data from the first data point below surface. bin to be cut * 4 is to be taken as input in cutbins.sh file
Step 2: Create AST daily data from 2012 (start) to end (2025)
                2.1 create ast daily for a given location, entire record.
                2.2 create ast daily for a given year.
                2.3 Regrid the above file to have the same time and depth axis corresponding to the actual DCnw1.nc file,
Step 3: Run the backscatter mullison c code and obtain the bs.
Step 4: Check for bad values, specially at surface and ends of the record
                4.1 Delete the end records,
                4.2 If the upper ocean data is bad, replace the top data with adjacent bottom data of backscatter.
