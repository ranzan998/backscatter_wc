fig 01) Map showing region of interest in eastern Arabian Sea. The slope moorings are
deployed at 1000 m depth as shown in the bathymetry contour. Note the increase in shelf width as we go poleward along the coast. The mooring sites off Okha and Mumbai are in Northern EAS; Jaigarh and Goa in Central EAS while Kollam and Kanyakumari are at Southern EAS. Udupi is situated at the transition zone of Central and Southern EAS.

fig 02) The Daily and monthly averaged biomass for EAS moorings, north (top) to south (bottom). The black contours are marking of 175 mg/m3 biomass for Okha and Kanyakumari; 215 mg/m3 for rest of the locations. The biomass contours are distinct and different based on the physicochemical parameters and the one that best explains seasonality at respective location. The top 10 % of data is discarded due to echo noise. The dashed line at 22 m marks the top-depth of first bin i.e, 24 m.

fig 03) Monthly climatology of zooplankton biomass is shown in left panels for 7 locations, (top to bottom is southward). The D175 & D215 are shown in solid lines; dashed line represents the depth of 23 C isotherm; oxygen contours are shown in dotted lines and labeled for each mooring. The right set of panel plots is showing ZSS and chlorophyll climatology for corresponding locations.

fig 04) The daily biomass at depth of 40 m and 104 m for all locations shown by grey and cyan curves. The black and blue lines shows the 30 day rolling averaged biomass at 40 and 104 m, respectively. Notice the bursts seen in the daily data ranging from few days to weeks. 

fig 05) The daily biomass (Only for 2018) at depth of 40 m and 104 m for all locations shown by grey and cyan curves. The black and blue lines shows the 30 day rolling averaged biomass at 40 and 104 m, respectively. 

fig 06) The biomass variation occurring in 100 to 250 days period (between the seasons within a year or Intra-annual) is obtained using a lancos band pass filter. The horizontal black and blue lines is for 40 and 104 m respectively; vertical black lines separate the years. The dashed line at 22 m marks the top-depth of first bin i.e, 24 m. 

fig 07) The biomass variation within a period of 300 to 400 days, called annual cycle is shown in this figure. The horizontal black and blue lines is for 40 and 104 m respectively; vertical black lines separate the years. The dashed line at 22 m marks the top-edge of first bin i.e, 24 m.

fig 08) Biomass variation found in the scale of 30 to 90 days  period (called Intra-seasonal band as it is within a season) is obtained using a lanczos band pass filter. The horizontal black and blue lines is for 40 and 104 m respectively; vertical black lines separate the years. The dashed line at 22 m marks the top-depth of first bin i.e, 24 m.  Intraseasonal variability is seen throughout the record and the variability is stronger during August to November. 

fig 09) The wavelet spectra analysis at 40 m biomass for 2018 against time as abscissa and period in days as ordinate. The wavelet power is in log2 scale, the 95 % significance is marked in black contours; The vertical solid black lines separates years.

fig 10) The wavelet spectra analysis of Zooplankton Standing Stock for 2018 against time as abscissa and period in days as ordinate. The wavelet power is in log2 scale, the 95 % significance is marked in black contours; The vertical solid black lines separates years.
