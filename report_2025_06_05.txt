Zooplankton standing stock (ZSS), estimated as the vertical integral of calibrated ADCP backscatter, captures both the vertical structure and temporal dynamics of zooplankton biomass in the eastern Arabian Sea (EAS). Building on Aparna et al. (2022), which analyzed seasonal ZSS variability at three locations, this study expands the spatial and temporal scope using seven moorings along the continental slope (2017–2023) at further lower temporal scale.

The vertical structure, characterized by a sharp decline in biomass from the surface to thermocline depth (D215/D175), remains consistent across all overlapping stations (Mumbai, Goa, and Kollam), reaffirming earlier findings. However, the spatial pattern of ecosystem function becomes clearer with the extended dataset. A distinct shift from a phytoplankton-dominated regime in the SEAS (e.g., Kollam) to a microbial-loop-dominated regime in the NEAS (e.g., Jaigarh, Okha) is now better resolved, with the CEAS emerging as a transition zone. This transition is marked by an inverse relationship between chl-a variability and ZSS variability; ZSS variance remains high in north even though chl-a drops northward. 

A key addition is the discovery of strong intraseasonal variability (5–90 days), particularly during monsoon transition months (August–November). These fluctuations, often as large as or larger than seasonal signals, are most prominent in the SEAS and diminish northward. Importantly, many such biomass bursts occur independently of chl-a peaks, underscoring the role of microbial processes in sustaining zooplankton, especially where classical food web links are weak or absent.

While the seasonal cycle of ZSS (winter(summer) maximum in the NEAS(SEAS)) broadly agrees with earlier results, the extended time series reveals interannual anomalies, such as a biomass collapse off Kollam in 2020, and a quasi-biennial signal (~720 days) that persists off Mumbai and Kollam in some years. These longer-period variations can modulate or obscure seasonal patterns as observed in Kollam.

The study confirms that variability at multiple time scales—intraseasonal, intra-annual, and interannual—significantly modulates ZSS. Moreover, out-of-phase biomass changes across depth layers (e.g., at 40 m vs. 104 m as in present study) can either amplify or cancel ZSS, depending on their sign, highlighting the need for vertical resolution in ecosystem assessments. Present expanded study and analysis reinforces earlier conclusions while revealing the dominant role of high-frequency variability and microbial loop processes in shaping zooplankton biomass in the EAS. It underscores the inadequacy of snapshot-based sampling and the necessity of high-resolution time series for ecosystem understanding and modeling.
