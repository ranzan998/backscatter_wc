Proposed plan for Backscatter manuscript:
The manuscript is an extension of Aparna et al's work. A major portion would be dedicated to discussing the zooplankton biomass timeseries and its relation to the local chlorophyll derived net primary productivity.
1) The role of advection: Amol et al (2020), zonal advection plays major role.
2) Circulation and eddy induced upwelling regimes (in southern mooring locations).
3) Exploring the reason behind higher standing stock in central EAS regimes.
	3.1) the northward propagation of the minimum standing stock from kanyakumari.
